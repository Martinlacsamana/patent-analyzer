# P.AI
A Next.js website for analyzing biomedical patents.

## How to Build
**Before starting building the site, make sure that npm is properly installed on your computer.**
To build the website for your local host, run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run dev
```
The website should appear in your browser at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) and be accessible through this port until you terminate the `npm run dev` command.

## Disclaimer
This website is a prototype only. The AI assistant is configured with a select set of patents (included for reference in the [examples folder](public/examples)) to minimize token use. If you would like to run it with the full AI capabilities, please contact the authors for the unabridged API connection.
