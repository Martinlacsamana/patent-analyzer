      problem: "The patent addresses the challenges of achieving robust ordered delivery of deformable beads in microfluidic devices, as well as the difficulty in achieving high percentage singlet encapsulation with a constant pressure source system.",
      problemKeywords: ["microfluidics", "beads", "singlet encapsulation"],
      solution: "The inventors developed a microfluidic device that can reliably achieve high percentage singlet encapsulation with a constant pressure source system. This was achieved through the development of a pinch and reservoir sequence system for beads concentrating and delivery frequency stabilizing, as well as the design of a long funnel to guide and align deformable beads into a single row, and a core design to achieve self-regulated beads in droplets encapsulation within a constant pressure system.",
      solutionKeywords: ["pinch and reservoir", "funnel"],
      summary: "This invention introduces a novel microfluidic device designed to improve the handling and processing of deformable beads in a controlled environment. The device features a series of inlets and microfluidic channels that facilitate the encapsulation of these beads into droplets, a method that is crucial for advancing laboratory assays such as single-cell analyses and other microreactor applications.",
